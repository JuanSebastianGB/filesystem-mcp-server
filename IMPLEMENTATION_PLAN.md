# MCP Server Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the File System MCP Server. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the tasks required to build a robust and feature-complete MCP server that interacts with the file system.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Set up MCP Server Core
- Install @model-context-protocol/server once available
- Create server instance
- Configure server options
- Implement error handling
- Set up logging system

### 2. Implement File System Operations
- Read file contents
- Write file contents
- List directory contents
- Create directory
- Delete file/directory
- Copy file/directory
- Move/rename file/directory
- Get file/directory stats

### 3. Add File Watching Capabilities
- Watch file/directory for changes
- Handle file change events
- Implement watch options
- Add watch removal functionality

### 4. Implement Path Operations
- Path resolution
- Path normalization
- Path validation
- Security checks
- Relative/absolute path conversions

### 5. Add Error Handling and Validation
- Input validation
- Permission checks
- File system error handling
- Custom error types
- Error reporting to client

### 6. Create TypeScript Types and Interfaces
- Request/Response types
- File system operations
- Configuration options
- Watch events
- Error types

### 7. Implement Configuration System
- Environment variables
- Configuration file support
- Runtime configuration
- Default settings

### 8. Add Tests
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- File system operation tests
- Error handling tests
- Watch functionality tests

### 9. Add Documentation
- API documentation
- Setup instructions
- Configuration guide
- Usage examples
- Contributing guidelines

### 10. Implement Security Features
- Path traversal protection
- Permission checks
- File access control
- Input sanitization
- Security best practices

## Development Approach

Each task will be implemented in separate PRs to maintain a clean and reviewable history. We'll focus on one component at a time, ensuring proper testing and documentation before moving to the next task.

## Timeline

- Tasks 1-4: Core functionality (Week 1)
- Tasks 5-7: Infrastructure and safety (Week 2)
- Tasks 8-10: Testing, documentation, and security (Week 3)

## Next Steps

1. Set up the core MCP server infrastructure
2. Begin implementing basic file system operations
3. Add tests for each component as we build
4. Review and iterate on the implementation plan as needed
